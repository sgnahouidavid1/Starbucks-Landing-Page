# Starbucks-Landing-Page
This project is a frontend website of The Starbucks Coffee shop landing page with limited functionallity, coded with CSS, HTML and a bit of JavaScript.
I will follow a youtube tutorial [Build a Starbucks Landing Page Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_n2FGNsm0o&list=WL&index=204) very minimally and was more hand on when building this website.

The purpose of this project is to gain a more understanding of building a responsive website with HTML and CSS
and a little of javascript to create the hamburger menu, the Footer links accordion, and transforming the hamburger memu icon to a X.

## A list of concepts I learn were: 
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  - Media Queries (responsiveness)
  - CSS Positioning, and Z-index
  - CSS Variables
  - Javascript accordion, hamburger menu
  - Css transformations, X/Y Translations, Rotating, and Transition
